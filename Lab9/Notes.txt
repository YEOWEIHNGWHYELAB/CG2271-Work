EventFlag-Test
---------1---------
0x3 in binary is 011. 

Green thread checks for 0x2 which is 010 i.e. it checks for 2nd bit of ctrl_flag only.

So when you set ctrl_flag to 0x3, both 2nd and 1st bit are set. The 2nd bit will trigger green LED
---------2---------
You can think of setting event flag as doing as assignment i.e. ctrl_flag = 0x3 (which is 0b011). 
Then oseventflagwait is like checking the specified bits to see if they are 1. 

e.g. waiting for 0x5 (0b101) is like checking whether both bit 3 and 1 are set. 

Waiting for 0x4 (0b100) is checking whether bit 3 is set (regardless of whether any other bits are set)
